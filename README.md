# Unhandled Modulus Operator in TypeScript Calculator

This repository demonstrates a common error in TypeScript: failing to handle all possible cases in a switch statement.  The provided TypeScript code implements a simple calculator with addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. However, it lacks handling for the modulus operator (`%`). This leads to an error when attempting to use the modulus operation.

The solution shows how to extend the switch statement to properly handle the modulus operator, thus making the calculator more robust.
